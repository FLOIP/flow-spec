# Flow Interoperability (FLOIP) - An Open Specification for Flows
## Introduction

The purpose of the project is to enable useful interoperability between Flow-based platforms, and to incentivize the joining of future software tools into an interoperable ecosystem.  We will accomplish this through a set of open specifications, and a set of open-source toolsets that reduce barriers to adoption.  The initial focus is on tools for mobile/web engagement, although the most basic layer of the specification is general and can represent non-mobile business logic.

## What are Flows?

Flows are a modern paradign for describing the logic of digital information systems that interact with individuals, often for the purpose of (a) collecting data or (b) providing information through interactive requests.  Some common examples of this are in mobile services using voice-based or SMS-based conversations over basic mobile phones. Flows follow the "flowchart" paradigm, consisting of actions (nodes) and connections between actions, which can incorporate decision-making logic.

## Who is working on this?

This is an initial collaboration between makers of Flow-like platforms and supporting tools: Nyaruka, InSTEDD, Ona, and VOTO Mobile.  UNICEF and USAID are providing guidance and input.  The project received initial funding from USAID. We hope that this project will outlast USAID funding and grow beyond the initial set of collaborating organisations.
