# Expressions

## Expressions

While a flow paradigm is useful in representing control logic in an easy to understand manner for non-technical users, there is a need to both refer to variables collected within other parts of a flow and transform them in basic ways.

Requirements:

* Given a dictionary \(the context\) and a string expression, evaluates to a dictionary value and an error which can be null
* Must allow easy variable substitutions within strings as this is the most common activity. ex: `Hi @contact.name`
* Must solve halting problem, we cannot let users build expressions which do not exit
* Must not allow looping, these should be represented in the flows themselves, we don't want programs

  in expressions, the logic should be in the flow. Same goes for declaration of variables etc

* Must allow for the vast majority of transformations users require, though we realize not all will be possible within

  an expression alone

### Excellent - Excel Inspired Expressions

Excellent is an expression language which consists of the functions provided by Excel with a few additions. This provides a number of advantages:

* No halting problem, a single function call \(possibly nested\)
* Many users are already familiar with the provided functions, as they have used them in Excel
* More complex expressions can be 'tried out' within Excel
* Excel's set of functions has evolved over time to capture most use cases while remaining lightweight
* Variables from the context are referenced using standard dot-notation

Function and variable names are not case-sensitive so UPPER is equivalent to upper:

* `contact.name` -&gt; `Marshawn Lynch`
* `FIRST_WORD(contact.name)` -&gt; `Marshawn`
* `first_word(CONTACT.NAME)` -&gt; `Marshawn`

Expressions can also include arithmetic with the add \(+\), subtract \(-\), multiply \(\*\), divide \(/\) and exponent \(^\) operators:

* `1 + (2 - 3) * 4 / 5 ^ 6` -&gt; `0.999744`

You can also join strings with the concatenate operator \(&\):

* `contact.first_name & " " & contact.last_name` -&gt; `Marshawn Lynch`

#### Types

Excellent will attempt to cast strings to the following types when used in functions:

* Strings
* Decimal values
* Datetimes: \(ISO 8601\) or `dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM(:SS)` or `mm-dd-yyyy HH:MM(:SS)` or `mm-dd` or `dd-mm` or `mm-dd-yy` or `dd-mm-yy` \(environment will help with ambiguous cases\)
* Boolean: True or False \(case insensitive\)

#### Logical comparisons

A logical comparison is an expression which evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. These may use the equals \(=\), not-equals \(&lt;&gt;\), greater-than \(&gt;\), greater-than-or-equal \(&gt;=\), less-then \(&lt;\) and less-than-or-equal \(&lt;=\) operators

* `contact.age > 18` -&gt; `TRUE`

Note that when comparing text values, the equals \(=\) and not-equals \(&lt;&gt;\) operators are case-insensitive.

### Templating

For templating, RapidPro uses the `@` character to denote either a single variable substitution or the beginning of an Excellent block. `@` was chosen as it is known how to type by a broad number of users regardless of keyboard. It does have the disadvantage of being used in email addresses and Twitter handles, but these are rarely ambiguous and escaping can be done easily via doubling of the character \(`@@`\).

Functions are called by using the block syntax: `10 plus 4 is @(SUM(10, 4))` Within a block, `@` is not required to refer to variable in the context: `Hello @(contact.name)` A template can contain more than one substitution or block: `Hello @contact.name, you were born in @(YEAR(contact.birthday))`

Examples below use the following context:

```javascript
{ 
   "contact": {
     "name": "Marshawn Lynch",
     "jersey": 24,
     "age": 30,
     "tel": "+12065551212",
     "birthday": "22-04-1986",
     "__value__": "Marshawn Lynch"
   },
   "channel": {
     "name": "Twilio 1423",
     "address": "1423"
   }
}
```

| Template | Evaluated | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hi @contact.name | Hi Marshawn Lynch |  |
| Hi @contact | Hi Marshawn Lynch | if a dictionary is referred to which has a `__value__` element, that is used in substitution |
| Hi @channel | Hi { "name": "Twilio 1423", "address": "1423" } | without a `__value__` element, JSON representation is substituted |
| You can contact us at foo@bar.com | You can contact us at foo@bar.com | bar is not in context, so passed through |
| You can contact us at foo@contact.com | You can contact us at foo@contact.com | contact.com not in context, so passed through |
| You can contact us at foo@@contact.tel | You can contact us at foo@contact.tel | `@@` escapes to `@` |
| Next year you will be @\(contact.age+1\) | Next year you will be 31 | simple math possible within expression |
| You first name is @\(WORD\(contact.name, 1\)\) | Your first name is Marshawn | Specific to Excellent, 1 based indexing |
| You are now @\(YEAR\(NOW\(\)\) - YEAR\(contact.birthday\)\) | You are now 30 | Conversion to date, then subtraction |
